            <p>Vegan salad that stands out..</p>

            <p>I still remember how hard it was to find quality resources when I first became vegan.

Sure, there have been some influential films and documentaries. But sometimes you’re in the mood to read a quick post to give you that boost of reassurance and a sense of belonging.

Tapping into vegan blogs is a great way to get fresh and unique content written by passionate individuals.

            <p>How vegan bread taste like..</p>

            <p>We want to know the bloggers behind the brand and what their personal story is. We also love vegan blogs that have a point of difference, whether it’s a type of cuisine they focus on or a design aesthetic.

For example, we cover a range of topics on this blog, but our North Star (link) is the intersection of minimalism and veganism. That’s what makes this blog unique.<a target="_blank" href="https://chooseveg.com/blog/the-11-food-bloggers-every-vegan-should-follow/">Read more...</a></p>

            <p>How to make our vegan dishes..</p>

            <p>As much as I love sitting down with my cookbooks and browsing for inspiration, there is something to be said for all the amazing food bloggers out there, working tirelessly to give us pretty pages with a variety of great recipes. And it's no different with vegan bloggers, who work extra hard to develop recipes that are distinctly lacking in animal products.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/top-10-vegan-blogs-follow.html">Read more...</a></p>
